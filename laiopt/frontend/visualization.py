"""
Safe plotting utilities for layout visualization.

This module provides visualization functions with:
- Bounded figure size to prevent memory issues
- No normalization affecting metrics
- Side-by-side comparison of baseline vs optimized layouts
- Quantitative metric display

All visualization is display-only and does not modify backend results.
