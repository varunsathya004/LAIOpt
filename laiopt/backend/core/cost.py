"""
Cost functions for placement evaluation.

This module implements:
- Wirelength calculation (HPWL/Manhattan distance)
- Overlap penalty (hard constraint)
- Die boundary violation penalty (hard constraint)
- Total cost computation combining all factors

Cost functions are used by the optimization engine to evaluate placement quality.
